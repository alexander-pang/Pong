# Pong
NOTE ON PLAYING IN BUILD: There are issues/glitches that don't exist during playing the game through unity. For some reason when a new ball is added, it will not move from the center.  And pressing restart breaks everything (the scores go back to zero, but the ball and paddles disappear and you can no longer play.  However the quit button will close the program like it is suppossed to).  Pause Screen still works properly, although the Pong title does not show up.   We have tried many different things to fix these issues to no avail. Please open the project in Unity and play it there, I promise you will have a better time.

How to Pause the game: Press the Esc key on your keyboard and the pause menu will pop up.  You may press Esc again to resume, or press the resume button.
On the puase menu, one player is already slected so you will be playing against a bot.  The 2 player button is not working, if you want to play against a human you must change 
the code in the Game Manager for the paddles. Set the second paddle to false.  The stats button is also not currently working, but the current scores during the game are shown on the main screen.

The reset button will reset the scores and start a new game. 

As time goes on there will be more balls added onto the field, making the game more fun and challenging.  The first player to 2 points wins.
